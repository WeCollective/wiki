### Stage 1: Suggestions
s/weco-suggestions

+ Users submit and vote on ideas
+ Popular ideas collaboratively developed into proposals

All users are encouraged to share and discuss new ideas or suggestions they have for the platform in the Suggestions branch (b/weco-suggestions). These can include ideas for new features, updates to existing features, bug fixes, out-reach approaches, spending decisions, or any other improvements to the project that you think should be considered by the members.

Once a suggestion has been posted, other users can then like it to show their support and/or discuss the suggestion in the comment thread, like any other post on the platform. If the suggestion gathers enough likes over time, it will be picked up by one of the platforms admins and moved to the next stage, becoming a ‘proposal’. The threshold currently used to determine the move from ‘suggestions’ to ‘proposals’ is based on when a post has gathered likes from more than 1% of the total user base. With a user base of 800 users, that would mean receiving more than 8 likes, however, this threshold is likely to be revised over time as more people get involved.

### Stage 2: Proposals
s/weco-proposals

+ Members discuss and vote on proposals
+ Supported proposals moved to Pending Tasks

When a suggestion has received enough likes in the suggestion branch, the platforms admins have the task of gathering together all the information related to the suggestion (including the original post and comment thread, any related content on the platform, and relevant external links or resources) and bundling it all together into an official proposal poll, which is then posted in the weco proposals branch (b/weco-proposals). Each new proposal poll would be structured as a ‘yes’/‘no’ binary poll and, while any user can comment on it, only members of coop are able to cast their vote. The decision to exclude non-members from voting on proposals has been made to protect the platform from Sybil attacks and insure that the people influencing the platforms decisions have at least some verifiable interest in upholding it’s values. If you would like to become a member, it only costs £3 a month / £30 a year and active developers gain membership for free.

As soon as a new proposal poll has been created, it is also added to the agenda for the next weekly meeting, where it will be allocated a dedicated time slot for members to discuss. Members will also be notified via email in case some can’t be present at the meeting. 

In the following week after the meeting in which the proposal has been discussed, all members of the coop then have the opportunity to vote on the poll. At the end of the week, if more than 60% of the participating members have voted to support the proposal, it is moved to the next ‘Pending Tasks’ stage. If less than 60% of the participating members vote to support the proposal it is abandoned. The original suggestion will, however, always remain in the suggestions branch and can later be forked or re-submitted for another review.

### Stage 3: Pending Tasks
s/weco-pendingtasks

+ Pending tasks mapped out and listed in b/weco-pendingtasks
+ Anyone can like and comment on tasks, donate money to tasks, or pitch in to complete tasks
+ Members vote to decide who tasks are allocated to
+ Allocated tasks marked as ‘active’ and moved to Active Tasks stage

---

### Stage 4: Active Tasks
s/weco-activetasks

+ Active tasks listed in b/weco-activetasks
+ Tasks linked to GitHub issues on project board and added to gantt chart timeline 
+ Individuals/groups allocated to each task required to post small updates on their progress each week while the task remains active
+ Completed tasks submitted for review

---

### Stage 5: Completed Tasks
s/weco-completedtasks

+ Completed tasks that pass the review stage listed in b/weco-completedtasks
+ New code merged into the develop branch, tested, and included in the next version release
+ Ongoing review of the completed task encouraged by any interested parties

### The Role of the Constitution
In order to protect the platform against negative mob-rule dynamics and uphold its cooperative and democratic principles, proposals that pass through the decision pipeline must abide by the rules set down in our [co-authored constitution]. Any proposal that fails to do so will be rejected before moving to a members vote.

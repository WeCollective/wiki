#### Cooperatively Owned, Democratically Governed, Open Source Social Media

<img src="/images/social-media-hologram.jpg" style="width: 600px">

**Weco.io** is an open source platform coop social network experimenting with new social network tools and approaches to governance.

Our main offering at the moment is a flexible [holonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holon_(philosophy)) framework for community sharing, organisation, interaction, and sense-making.

We are:
+ Democratically governed by users and members
+ Fully Open Source
+ Transitioning into a Cooperative Society in the UK
+ Developing new features

Over the last 20 years, [social media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media) platforms have profoundly impacted the way humans are able to connect, communicate, and find information online. 

For the first time in history it’s possible to build communities that weave together individuals from all around the world sharing common interests almost instantaneously and keep everyone up to date with the latest news in real-time.

Hardly anyone would deny the value of these tools, yet increasingly people are beginning to question the underlying logic that shapes these influential systems.

While features such as ‘up-votes’ and ‘likes’ facilitate radically collaborative and democratic filtering of shared content at scale, the overarching governance of these platforms remains surprisingly opaque and dictatorial.

Private ownership, with a fiduciary duty to maximise shareholder profits, also creates a misalignment between the interests of those governing the platform and the wider user base who actually generate its value; often resulting in features that maximise time spent on the platform and increase ad revenue being prioritised over those that would enrich the commons.

Initiatives like the [Platform Cooperativism](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Platform_Cooperativism) movement and the [Center for Humane Technology](https://humanetech.com/home) are working hard to articulate these problems and point to new solutions but changing the dominant paradigm upon which these social media giants have been founded is fraught with challenges.

Raising the initial funding to develop new social networks, without selling off shares (and ultimately control) to wealthy investors, is notoriously difficult and, despite the fact that most people recognise the importance of democratic principles in theory, organising real democratic governance in practise requires a lot more planning and thought than traditional dictatorial hierarchies. [also, network effects]

None of these challenges, however, are insurmountable. While we now take for granted the superiority of representative democracies over earlier more dictatorial political structures, it took centuries, even millennia, of deep thought and struggle to arrive at these designs.

[Weco](https://www.weco.io/) is one of many newly emerging attempts to imagine what a more advanced social network could be, unconstrained by these previously restricting forces and founded instead upon democratic, cooperative, and open source principles. 

To get an idea of some of the advantages a system like this could enable, consider the following points:

+ Imagine if Reddit, Twitter, or Facebook, allowed their users to suggest and vote together on new features they would like built into the design and then helped fund their development (in combination with crowdfunding). A whole ecosystem of competing features could be developed, tested, and eventually integrated into a growing suite of public open source tools, freely available to users and communities. 
+ Imagine if we were allowed to participate together each year voting on how the surplus profits generated by our activity on these sites was spent. Facebook alone, generates [billions in annual profits](), yet none of its users currently have any say in how that money is spent. Instead of lining the wallets of super wealthy shareholders, that money could instead be used to fund important commons based projects, regenerative work, charities, and other collectively governed ventures.
+ Imagine if we regained control over the [incredibly powerful resource]() of public data that’s generated within these frameworks and instead of using it to target ads and political messages that give influence to those with the money to pay for it, it was harnessed for public good (from research to education, and public decision making). 

These are just a few of the exciting possibilities new social networks could enable in the near future if we manage to develop the tools and frameworks they require.

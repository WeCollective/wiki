# Current Features

+ the ability to create ‘branches’ (communities/sharing-spaces/holons)
    + the original creator of a branch becomes its moderator, gaining the ability to:
        + add/remove new moderators
        + set the branches visible name, description, and ‘rules & etiquette’
        +  change the flag and cover image
        +  add or remove child-branches
        + accept or reject new child-branch requests from other users
        + request to be located in other parent-branches
        + delete the branch
        + moderate flagged posts
        + change the post type
        + mark a post as NSFW
        + remove the post from the branch
+ within each branch, anyone can:
    + submit posts
    + like posts
    + comment on posts
    + flag posts (as ‘against site rules’, ‘against branch rules’, ‘NSFW’, or ‘wrong post type’)
    + repost posts
    + search posts (coming soon)
    + filter posts by:
        + Time range: all time, last year, last month, last week, last 24 hours, last hour
        + Sort by: points, comments, date
        + Post type: all, pages, images, video, audio, text, poll
        + Point type: ‘global’ (total points received on the post in all locations on the site), ‘local’ (points received on post within the current branch and it’s child branches), ‘branch’ (only points received within the current branch, not including it’s child-branches)
+ content posted to child-branches is aggregated in their parent-branches
    + In the following hierarchy: A>B>C
        + a post submitted to branch A at the top will only appear within A
        + a post submitted to branch B in the middle will appear within A and B
        + a post submitted to branch C at the bottom will appear within A, B, and C
    + If you’re browsing the wall of the main b/science branch, for example, this means it’s integrating content from all of its contained child-branches (b/biology, b/physics, b/chemistry) into one feed (without the need for unnecessary reposts/duplications)
    + You can then jump down the holoarchy to narrow the scope of your browsing as required
    + Posts that gain traction at lower levels can gradually rise up the walls of higher branches with a smoother point/exposure gradient than on other platforms like Reddit where each community is completely separate
+ branches can be organised by the date they were created or by their total points, posts, or comments, making it easy to find the most used branches for each topic and allowing for evolution in the design as variations of branches compete to meet users needs
+ posts can include URL links, text content, embedded images/youtube videos, and polls
+ posts can be tagged with multiple branches so they appear in each branch simultaneously without the need for duplications
+ comments are organised into filterable ‘comment trees’ like on Reddit, allowing you to expand out replies to comments at any level of a thread, with permalinks available for each comment
+ notifications received to your account for relevant activity (comments on your post, replies to your comments, child-branch requests, flagged posts etc.)
+ The top-child branches are displayed to the right of the branches wall on large screens and at the bottom of the left hand side-bar on small screens, for quick navigation. They are currently ranked by the number of points received on posts in each child-branch.
+ Users can follow branches, which then appear on their profile page for quick navigation
